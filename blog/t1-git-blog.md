# Version Control

## Or - the joys of Git & Github

02/11/2014

The benefits of version control are many - keep track of your changes, being able to revert to previous versions, and being able to share and coordinate your changes with others.

The most popular tool today to do this is Git, and one of the most popular Git repositories is GitHub.  Git helps you keep track of changes by storing files, their differences between versions, and others versions or changes of the same files.

You should use Github to store your files since that's how you can share your files with Dev Bootcamp (whose files are hosted on Github), and because it's now the same as a technical resume.
