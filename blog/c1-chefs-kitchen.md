## Kitchen or restaurant?

2/11/2014

Just wanted a video by Shareef (sp?).  Absolutely loved the content the more and more I got into it.

A few highlights - the efforts on cooperative learning, how little natural intelligence (past a bar of normal IQ) plays in success vs EQ, and how to time box.

Right now, I'm working on his immediate hints for success - doing as much as possible in prep, and enjoying my fellow classmates!
