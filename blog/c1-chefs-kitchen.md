<!-- This template is in markdown, not html, so
  it will not render beautifully when you copy and

  least be published. Next week you'll be creating a
  blog template using HTML and CSS and you'll be able
  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),
  and date with the text you would like. Markdown is pretty
  simple, so you can just feel free to type. =) You'll want

Just wanted a video by Shareef (sp?).  Absolutely loved the content the more and more I got into it.

A few highlights - the efforts on cooperative learning, how little natural intelligence (past a bar of normal IQ) plays in success vs EQ, and how to time box.

Right now, I'm working on his immediate hints for success - doing as much as possible in prep, and enjoying my fellow classmates!
