    <h2>Pairing:</h2>
    <h3>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</h3>

    <p>It's great fun! Everyone has something to contribute!</p>

    <h3>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</h3>

    <p>It's great when someone has a different approach or style of looking at things. </p>

    <h3>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</h3>

    <p>Sometimes reminding yourself to stay with one role (driver or navigator, not both), can prove challenging</p>

    <h2>Feedback:</h2>
    <h3>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</h3>

    <p>It's key to keep in the growth mindset and use feedback as an opportunity to learn.</p>

    <h3>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</h3>

    <p>Yes, very helpful!</p>

    <h3>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</h3>

    <p>Set the objective and time limit up front, as well as a timer to switch roles.</p>

    <h3>How was it to write feedback?</h3>

    <p>Giving great feedback is hard!</p>

    <h3>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</h3>

    <p>Giving useful feedback when I felt the other person really had nothing to improve.</p>
