    <h2>Gregorc Thinking Style</h2>
    <p>My dominant thinkig style is concreate random - this is described as <i>risk-takers and innovators, concrete random dominant thinkers like to work hands-on and use their intuition to solve problems, often in rapid, intuitive leaps. They thrive in a competitive environment and prefer to work alone when solving problems.

    It can be very difficult for a concrete random dominant thinker to follow rigid processes. Anything from providing detailed documentations, to reporting or even explaining how they reached a specific conclusion can be difficult for someone with this dominant thinking style. They also struggle with routine and repetition. The same creative thinking that helps them solves problems can make it difficult for them to do routine parts of their job.</i></p>

    <p>The biggest struggle at this point has been when I haven't understood how something works, namely CSS.  And to the point about concrete random thinkers, the approach that appeals most to me is to play around with the CSS sheets to figure out what's going on.  As well, in terms of time management, Pomodoro (when applied) has really helped with being a concrete random thinker.</p>
