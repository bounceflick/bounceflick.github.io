    <h2>An issue facing the tech industry: Is there a bubble?</h2>
    <p>Possibly the issues of most relevance to me is whether there's a tech bubble - is it primed for a crash as we've seen earlier this century?  This has immediate consequences in terms of employability and direct income.</p>

    <p>While if there is a crash, my employment prospects will suffer, I'm comfortable in the knowledge I'm building a long term skill set.  This should stand the test of time, whether boom or bust.</p>
