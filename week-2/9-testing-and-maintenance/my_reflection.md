## 9. Testing and Maintenance Reflection

Include images of your maintenance schedule (inline, using markdown) below:

Schedule:
Bloody hell, it's a hour a day.
***
1. While testing, did you find any errors in your code? How did you handle them?
  * Haven't tested yet.
2. Did you receive any particularly helpful feedback? Why was it helpful?
  * Not quite, haven't tweeted yet.
3. How do you plan to incorporate the feedback you received?
  * When I get some, I'll let you know.
