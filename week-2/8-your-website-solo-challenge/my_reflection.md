My Wireframe URL:

My Website url:

Discuss the following:
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
  * Should have been more exacting in terms of how I followed the wireframe.  Much harder to change in code
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
  * Make it even more simple.  Reorganize the index and blog pages.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
  * Not incredibly.
* Create a TODO list of features you want to add in the future.
  * Clean up web page.
  * Copy others best formatting.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  * Right now, trying to keep up!
