## 11. GPS 1.1 Reflection

- What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  * Rolling back changes.
- What was clarified during the GPS?
  * Branches, especially git checkout -b
- What (if anything) was made more confusing?
  * I don't remember much from it, at this point, so wish I had a recorded session.
- How was your first experience of pairing in a guided pairing session?
  * Was just me and one other person, so didn't have the experience of paring.
- Was having a guide there intimidating? helpful? reassuring?
  * It was ok, more like a more knowledgable pair.
- What were your 'aha' moments?
  * No extreme moments.
